## Repos:


[simple_music_player](https://github.com/mariuszsak/simple_music_player) - Just simple music player. Currently finished, plans: integration with Spotify.


[msshop_mobile](https://github.com/mariuszsak/msshop_mobile) - Fake "Glass Shop" mobile version. WIP, TODO: styling, user profile after successfully login, better info screen, tests, some code cleaning, etc). Current branch: [develop](https://github.com/mariuszsak/ms-shop/tree/develop). App works.

[ms-shop](https://github.com/mariuszsak/ms-shop) - Fake "Glass Shop" backend (WIP, TODO: tests atm) and frontend (not ready at all because I'm focusing on mobile version first). Current branch: [develop](https://github.com/mariuszsak/ms-shop/tree/develop). App works.
